# Day-by-Day-Logo-Maker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My Motivations were to create an SVG logo maker using Node.js, inquirer and Jest
- I built this project to utilise the skills i learn't in Node.js, inquirer and Jest.
- The user gets an easy to use logo maker that can generate a simple SVG formatted logo
- I learn't that Object Oriented Programming is about pre-determing certain characteristics based on the context of your app, for example; In my application the different shapes were different objects

## Installation

Install the required npm system packages (inquirer, node.js).
run "node index.js" to begin the application


## Usage

Once you have opened the app, and run "node index.js" you will be given 4 questions to answer to design your SVG logo. Once you have chosen those questions an SVG file will be made in the "examples" folder

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
